TODOS:
Figure out how to payout 1st, 2nd, and 3rd at end of comp.
How to store a and retrieve a sample on competition buyin.  Whats the best way? Private dropbox, Mediafire, google drive? IPFS to keep it web3? 
Update homepage to take in how many people are in the current competition. Add price of buyin maybe.
Calls to contract to join comp and Mint NFT needs to be set up.
Admin page to create competitions needs to be created in mind of future ability for users to create competitions.
Should the pool be accessible if not in competition? Already configured to block users if competition is full, but may be nice to disable feature to not confuse users.
Market place needs to be created.
Discord page.
About page.
